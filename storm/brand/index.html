                <p>STORM is a <b>yacht finishing company founded in 2002</b>. It works hand in hand with yachting world leaders in new build construction, in both Italy and Germany. Over recent years STORM has grown refit volume and succesfully completed projects up to 100m in Europe and Asia.</p>

                <h1 id="story">The brand story</h1>
                    <img src="story.png">
                    <p>Back in the days yacht finishing was hard-yet-fun work. There were more margins for everyone in the industry, and then beers and parties. But especially lighthearted time to enjoy some surfing, when work was over. Nowadays, instead, even the richest shipowners want more for less. All trying to take the fun out of work.</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, in the last 15 years STORM has managed to grow from a small company to an international-level one. Thanks to a continuous effort towards harder challenges, today STORM is not the silent boy in the class anymore. Today STORM works on 20.000 square meters at once.</p>
                    <p> But this doesn’t mean there are no more challenges - improving never goes out of fashion. Ever better training and knowhow is necessary for production and quality inspection. Management needs the most up-to-date tools and software, to foresee the unforeseeable. Effort in communication and collaboration are more important than ever before.</p>

                <h6>The vision</h6>
                    <img src="vision.png">
                    <p class="image-description">STORM envisions a world where <b>continuous improvement makes everything work flawlessly.</b><br><br>So that everyone can go back to surfing.</p>

                <h6>The payoff</h6>
                    <p>Everyone in STORM is different, but something everyone must share to work in the company is <b>courage</b> - to embrace problems; <b>passion</b> - to feel fulfilled when the best boat possible is finished; <b>enterprenaurship</b> - to find new solutions to new problems. That's why we say that...</p>
